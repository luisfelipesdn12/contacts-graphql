# `contacts-graphql`
ðŸ“• An API to manage contacts using GraphQL and Typescript

## ðŸ“– About
That's my very first project with both TypeScript and GraphQL. It's a simple API where is possible to manage contacts by reading, adding, modifying and deleting them, with GraphQL operations.

## ðŸš€ Running
You can see the working of this project with a deployed version [here](https://luis-contacts-graphql.herokuapp.com/). But to run it locally, follow the steps:

```sh
# Clone this repository and go to the project root
git clone https://github.com/luisfelipesdn12/contacts-graphql.git
cd contacts-graphql

# Install the dependences
npm install
# or: yarn

# Build and start the project
npm run build
# or: yarn build
npm run start
# or: yarn start
``` 

It should result in a log in the terminal saying which port you should access. For default, it may be http://localhost:6060/

## ðŸ’» Technologies
Used TypeScript & NodeJS with the following dependencies:

- [**apollo-server**](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) - To handle the GraphQL requests.
- [**lowdb**](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) - Small local JSON database to store the contacts.
- [**type-graphql**](https://typegraphql.com/) - Used to generate GraphQL schema and resolvers.
- [**uuid**](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) - Generates IDs for contacts.
